## Location
For my dirt project, I chose the location to be our small garden at home, or more specifically my palm tree. When I was 11 years old, my grandfather planted 4 palm trees in front of our house. Each of my sisters and I chose a palm tree to be theirs. Yet, their palm tree was just a tree, a thing, they never cared about it. As for my, I spent alot of time with my palm tree. I often watered my palm tree, had long conversations with my grandfather by itside, and sometimes convwersation with the palm tree itself. I love my palm tree. When my palm tree grows dates, I get very excited. While all the palm trees were of the same size at the start, my palm tree soon surpassed their heights. When dates season comes, my palm tree gives the most dates. My palm tree is loved.

## Medium
In order to express the story of the palm tree and I, and how my love nutured my tree, I chose to create a game. In the game, the player can click on the 'r' key to read to the palm tree, or click on the 'w' key to water the palm tree. As the player reads and waters the plant, the plant grows more and more.
