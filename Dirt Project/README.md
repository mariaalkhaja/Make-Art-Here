## Location
For my dirt project, I chose the location to be our small garden at home, or more specifically my palm tree. When I was 11 years old, my grandfather planted 4 palm trees in front of our house. Each of my sisters and I chose a palm tree to be theirs. Yet, their palm tree was just a tree, a thing, they never cared about it. As for my, I spent alot of time with my palm tree. I often watered my palm tree, had long conversations with my grandfather by itside, and sometimes convwersation with the palm tree itself. I love my palm tree. When my palm tree grows dates, I get very excited. While all the palm trees were of the same size at the start, my palm tree soon surpassed their heights. When dates season comes, my palm tree gives the most dates. My palm tree is loved. 

## Medium
In order to express the story of the palm tree and I, and how my love nutured my tree, I chose to create a game. In the game, the player can click on the 'r' key to read to the palm tree, or click on the 'w' key to water the palm tree. As the player reads and waters the plant, the plant grows more and more. A backgroud sound with birds and nature is played thoughout the game to immerse the player into nature.

## Challenges 
One of the most challenging parts of creating the game was finding suitable illustrations. While there are a few free illustrations for common games availabe, it was hard to find illustrations of a girl readinging or separate chuncks of a tree trunk to build upon. Moreover, while creating the game, I encountered a few errors. Since my professor is not a programmer, whenever I got an error, I got very frustrated and anxious since I had to figure it out all on my own. However, in the end, I managed to make it all work. 

## Artist Statement
In my art, I try to emphasise the relationship between a loving, nurturing relationship and growth. I use a tree to show that this relationship. I once loved a tree in my garden, and my tree my tree grew to be the largest and most flourished. Even with a tree, which we do not consider to have emotions, the correlation still applies. 

To get this message across, I use mini-game, where the user chooses to read or sing to the tree, and the tree keeps growing as the user invests more time with the tree. The user gets to interact first-hand with the tree. The user can feed and water the tree as little as he likes. There is no way to lose the game, but there is a way to reach ulitmate growth. The user gets to see the direct result of their actions.
